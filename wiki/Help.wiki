==Filling a bug report==

<font size="3">
Don't forget to give the following information (if they are relevant of course):

|| *Version* || The version of Gambas used (2.XX, /trunk for the Gambas 3 development version or /branches/2.0 for the next Gambas 2 version). ||
|| *Revision* || The subversion repository revision if you are using a development version. ||
|| *Operating system* || The operating system used (Linux, FreeBSD...). ||
|| *Distribution* || The distribution used (Ubuntu, Fedora, !ArchLinux, Gentoo...) ||
|| *Architecture* || If you run Gambas on 32 bits, 64 bits, or on ARM. ||
|| *GUI component* || If you use QT3, QT4, GTK+ or the default gb.gui component. ||
|| *Desktop used* || If you run your program on Gnome, KDE, E17... ||
</font>

==Important notes==

<font size="3">
  * Don't create an issue if you have a compilation problem on the development version. Send a mail to the mailing-list instead.

  * If you encounter several different problems or bugs, (for example, a bug in your project, and an interpreter crash while debugging it), please create distinct issues!

  * Google automatically replaces references to Gambas development revision with links to its own source code repository, which Gambas does not use at all. So ignore these links with disdain.
